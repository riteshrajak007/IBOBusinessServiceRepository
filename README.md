# IBOBusinessServiceRepository

Swagger URL to Azure app service - https://ibocorebusinessserviceapi-ritesh801595.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html

unable to create Azure SQL DB , Since My Azure subscription has not enough cost to create Azure SQL DB.
I think this is an issue with my passcode subscription.

Hence to run the app - need to run the code migration and create a local db and changing the DB connection string in appsettings.json accordingly
